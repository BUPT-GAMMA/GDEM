## Download Datasets
For Citeseer Pubmed and Squirrel, the code will directly download them.
For Reddit, Flickr, and Ogbn-arXiv, we use the datasets provided by [GraphSAINT](https://github.com/GraphSAINT/GraphSAINT). They are available on [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zycmmDES39zVlbVCYs88JTJ1Wm5FbfLz) (the links are provided by GraphSAINT team). 
For twitch-gamer, you can access it at [Twitch-Gamer](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11Xas4r6oBvDzDzqHT-cEd35nX9X3q3yf/view?usp=sharing).
Download the files and unzip them to `data` at the root directory. 

## Instructions

(1) Run preprocess.py to preprocess the dataset and conduct the spectral decomposition.

(2) Initialize node features of the synthetic graph by running feat_init.py.

(3) Distill the synthetic graph by running distill.py.

(4) you can evaluate the cross-architecture generalization performance of the synthetic graph on various GNNs (GCN, SGC, PPNP, ChebyNet, BernNet, GPR-GNN) by running test_other_arcs.py.
